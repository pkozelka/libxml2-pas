Subject: ANN: libxml2 for DELPHI/KYLIX: version 2.4.15 released

Hello all,
(sorry for the cross-posting)

I am happy to announce that the newest Pascal translations of libxml2
headers were just released.
This release matches libxml2-2.4.15 release, as indicated inthe subject.

Note that, besides this package, the libxml2-pas sourceforge project works
on following modules:
- header translations for libxslt (not yet completed; help wanted!)
- Dom2 wrappers based on JAXP model (under heavy development)
    Currently we develop this wrapper for these well-known implementations:
    - MSXML (win32 only)
    - LIBXML (win32, Linux)
    - support for Xerces-C (win32, Linux) would be highly welcome
- MSXML DOM compatible wrapper (currently not developed much)
- iconv.h translation, a work in progress, is actually included in libxml2-pas at the moment

****************************
Help wanted for all modules!
****************************
Anyone willing to contribute by patches, testcases, bugreports,
documentation, hints or
just "Hi, I am using it!" messages is welcome to post on our open mailing list:
libxml2-pas-devel@lists.sourceforge.net .

This translation will be also donated to the Delphi-JEDI project soon.
